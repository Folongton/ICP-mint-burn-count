## Usage

1. **Navigation**: Use the sidebar to select different analysis types
2. **Interactive Charts**: 
   - Use dropdown menus in trend charts to switch between timeframes
   - Hover over data points for detailed information
3. **Predictions**: View ensemble predictions with confidence assessments
4. **Speed Analysis**: Analyze rate of change patterns

## Data Requirements

The app expects a CSV file with the following columns:
- `date`: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `supply_change`: Daily supply change values
- `supply_change_pct`: Supply change percentage
- `total_supply`: Total supply values

## Notes

- Predictions are based on trend extrapolation and should be interpreted with caution
- Low RÂ² values indicate high uncertainty in trend-based predictions
- External factors (policy changes, market events) may significantly alter actual outcomes
- The app automatically handles missing data and calculates rolling averages
